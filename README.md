# Sleepless Discord JS Tutorial


Hello! I made this basic bot project using [Sleepless' Discord JS Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3qq7zxd-oPDvBrMKtLkI0rQI6Rt_WK58) I would highly suggest checking out his videos so you understand what each thing means.


Join his discord server [here](https://discord.gg/WKDeFzz).

I did not write any of this code by myself. I got all of this code from his YouTube tutorials.


If you would like to visually see the bot's functionalities and commands before using this code, invite the bot to your guild [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=723710749234430103&permissions=8&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fdashboard%2Fcallback&scope=bot)
